ComfyUI-OFTv2
---

A custom node to support and load OFTv2 adapters until official ComfyUI support is added https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/issues/10695

Includes the following nodes:
- "Load OFTv2" (Model/Clip)
- "Load OFTv2 Model Only" (Model)

They work the same way as LoRA loader node, except they support OFTv2.
